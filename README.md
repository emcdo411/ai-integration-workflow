# ü§© Aeristo Data Integration Case Study & Phased Implementation Plan

---

## üìå Summary

This document outlines a modern, scalable ETL and data integration strategy for Aeristo, a Dallas-based luxury leather goods company specializing in bespoke interiors for high-end automobiles and private aircraft (e.g., Gulfstream G6, G7). The goal is to integrate legacy data from Microsoft Dynamics AX (pre-2023) with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central (current live data), enabling real-time analytics through Excel, Power BI, and R Shiny applications. The project is structured in three phases‚Äîdata integration and ETL pipeline setup, reporting and dashboard development, and ongoing optimization‚Äîdelivering a cloud-native, secure solution as of June 2025.

## üß≠ Business Problem

Aeristo relies on two disconnected systems:

* **Microsoft Dynamics AX**: Legacy ERP (pre-2023) storing customer, vendor, sales, and purchasing history (\~500K records).
* **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central**: Cloud-based ERP for real-time operations post-2023.

**Key Challenge:** The lack of integration between these systems limits Aeristo‚Äôs ability to combine historical and live data, hindering data-driven decisions for inventory management, sales forecasting, and customer insights critical to their luxury leather operations.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Overview

The solution leverages a modern ETL pipeline to:

* Extract historical data from Dynamics AX via SQL Server or OData.
* Transform it to align with Business Central‚Äôs schema.
* Load it incrementally to minimize system impact.

**API endpoints enable:**

* R Shiny dashboards for advanced analytics (e.g., demand forecasting).
* Power BI and Excel reports for stakeholder accessibility.

The implementation is divided into three phases:

1. **Phase 1:** Data Integration and ETL Pipeline Setup (3-4 months).
2. **Phase 2:** Reporting and Dashboard Development (2-3 months).
3. **Phase 3:** Optimization and Maintenance (ongoing).

## üõ†Ô∏è ETL Strategy & Middleware

### üîÑ ETL Process (Incremental)

The ETL process unifies historical and live data:

* **Extract:** Retrieve data from Dynamics AX using SQL Server or OData.
* **Transform:** Align schemas, reformat dates, and tag metadata.
* **Load:** Push transformed data to Business Central via APIs or stage in Azure SQL Database.

### üßçÔ∏è‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Middleware: Azure Data Factory

* Low-code, cloud-native ETL platform with native connectors.
* Supports incremental loads, automated scheduling, and logging.
* Optional Azure Synapse Analytics integration for advanced transformation.

### ‚úÖ Benefits

* **Cloud-native**: Eliminates on-premises infrastructure.
* **Reporting-ready**: Compatible with Power BI, Excel, and R Shiny.
* **Secure**: Governed by Azure Security Center.

## üõ†Ô∏è Phase 1: Data Integration and ETL Pipeline Setup

***Estimated Timeframe:** 3-4 months*

### **Tasks Involved:**

* **Assess Data Sources:** Map schemas and evaluate quality.
* **Configure Azure Data Factory (ADF):** Setup incremental load pipelines.
* **Set Up Azure SQL Staging Layer:** Clean and validate data.
* **Develop ETL Pipeline:** Execute extract, transform, load.
* **Test and Validate:** Pilot loads and diagnostics.
* **Enable API Access:** Publish OData/REST APIs for reporting.

## üìä Data Consumption for Reporting

* **Excel/Power BI**: Pulls data from Azure SQL and OData feeds.
* **R Shiny**: Provides custom interactive dashboards with API-based real-time data.

*See original document for code snippets and R dashboard examples.*
